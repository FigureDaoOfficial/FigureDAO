# Roadmap

In order to make the experience of incorporating all the moving pieces of the ecosystem as seamless and convenient for projects/users/community as possible, we have carefully developed a roadmap that will slowly incorporate all the building blocks and ultimately provide the new BSC/ETH liquidity exponentiated ecosystem.

| Phase 1| Phase 2| Phase 3| Phase 4|
|--|--|--|--|
| During the first Phase, we plan to release Figure DAO - $FDAO on the Binance Smart chain mainnet with its core features - fixed price pools, $FDAO token staking for pool access, and liquidity mining. We began working on Phase I and Phase II deliverables almost 1 months ago.| Listing and launch of beta mobile app on GooglePlay store. | While we believe that Figure DAO will be launched on the ETH mainnet in Q2 2023, we want to reserve sufficient room for development as we will have to code from scratch the entire smart contract codebase in the new layer 2 Arbitrum. Figure DAO should be launched on the Arbitrum mainnet and development on BSC/ETH and Arbitrum is to follow.| In this phase, we expect to deploy the DAO governance solution into all networks and bridge all together.
